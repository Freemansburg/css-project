              <h2>TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW</h2>
              <p>Gnaeus Marcius, also known as Coriolanus, was a great military hero of
                ancient Rome. In the first half of the fifth century B.C. he won many important battles, saving the city from calamity time and time again. Because he
                spent most of his time on the battlefield, few Romans knew him personally,
                making him something of a
                legendary figure.
                In 454 B.C., Coriolanus decided it was time to exploit his reputation
                and enter politics. He stood for election to the high rank of consul. Candi—
                dates for this position traditionally made a public address early in the race,
                and when Coriolanus came before the people, he began by displaying the
                dozens of scars he had accumulated over seventeen years of fighting for
                Rome. Few in the crowd really heard the lengthy speech that followed;
                those scars, proof of his valor and patriotism, moved the people to tears.</p>

              <h2>Section 2</h2>
              <p>
                Coriola.nus’s election seemed certain.
                When the polling day arrived, however, Coriolanus made an entry
                into the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city’s patricians, the
                aristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by such a
                blustering show of confidence on election day.
                And then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citizens who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and insolent.
                Claiming certain victory in the vote, he boasted of his battlefield exploits,
                made sour jokes that appealed only to the patricians, voiced angry accuser»
                tions against his opponents, and speculated on the riches he would bring to
                Rome. This time the people listened: They had not realized that this legendary soldier was also a common braggart.

              <h2>Section 3</h2>
              <p>The senate was ready to distrib~
                ute this food to the people, for free, but just as they were preparing to vote
                on the question Coriolanus appeared on the scene and took the senate
                floor. The distribution, he argued, would have a. harmful effect on the city
                as a whole. Several senators appeared won over, and the vote on the distribution fell into doubt. Coiiolanus did not stop there: He went on to con—
                demo the concept of democracy itself. He advocated getting rid of the
                people’s represen!atives—the tribunes-—-and turning over the governing of
                the city to the patricians.</p>
